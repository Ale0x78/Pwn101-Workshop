## CSC405 workshop on Binary Hacking

These were the workshop files for a binary hacking workshop I ran for CSC 405â€”Computer Security at NC State University. 

The goal is to walk the students through solving levels 1a and 2a and then letting them solve 1b and 2b. `make all` can be used to rebuild the binaries; however, the workshop was intended for an x86_64 (AMD64) machine.
